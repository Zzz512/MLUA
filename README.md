# Panoramic-Caries-Segmentation
The first public project for teeth caries segmentation based on  dental panoramic X-ray images

Here have have placed the code and test samples for our previous work "Multi-level Uncertainty Aware Semi-supervised
Learning for Dental Panoramic Caries Segmentation". And the all training data download link will be attached after our paper accepted.

If you are interested in the task of segmenting caries in panoramic images, we believe our new work on structured segmentation of dental tissues and classification of caries will capture your interest.
